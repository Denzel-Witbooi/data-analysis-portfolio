## COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL ()
This project is an SQL data analysis of a COVID-19 dataset from 2021. The dataset contains information related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and other relevant statistics. The analysis is performed using SQL queries to gain insights and extract meaningful information from the dataset.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [insert dataset source here]. It includes the following fields:

**Field 1**: Description of field 1.
**Field 2**: Description of field 2.
...

### Setup

1. SQL database management system (DBMS) installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. The dataset downloaded and imported into the DBMS.

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL].
2. Install the required dependencies (if any).
3. Import the dataset into your DBMS.
4. Update the database connection details in the SQL script, if necessary.
5. Running the Analysis

To perform the SQL analysis, follow these steps:

Open your preferred SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin).
Connect to the database where you imported the dataset.
Run the SQL script provided in this repository.
Examine the query results and explore the insights gained from the analysis.
SQL Queries
The SQL script in this repository includes several queries that explore different aspects of the COVID-19 dataset. These queries cover areas such as:

Query 1: Description of query 1.
Query 2: Description of query 2.
...
Query n: Description of query n.
Feel free to modify and extend the SQL queries to suit your specific analysis needs.
