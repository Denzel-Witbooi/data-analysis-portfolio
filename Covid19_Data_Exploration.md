# Covid-19 Data Exploration

This project aimed to explore trends and factors influencing the movie industry's revenue over the last decades. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle by Daniel Grijalva, contains information on 6820 movies spanning from 1986 to 2016. Various attributes such as budget, production company, country of origin, director, genre, revenue, rating, release date, duration, IMDb user rating, number of user votes, main actor/actress, writer, and year of release were analyzed using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
